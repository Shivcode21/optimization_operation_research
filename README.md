## optimization_operation_research

# Description
Operational planning and long term planning for companies are more complex in recent years. Information changes fast, and the decision making is a hard task. Therefore, optimization algorithms (operations research) are used to find optimal solutions for these problems. Professionals in this field are one of the most valued in the market.

In this course you will learn what is necessary to solve problems applying Mathematical Optimization and Metaheuristics:

Linear Programming (LP)

Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)

NonLinear Programming (NLP)

Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MINLP)

Genetic Algorithm (GA)

Multi-Objective Optimization Problems with NSGA-II (an introduction)

Particle Swarm (PSO)

Constraint Programming (CP)

Second-Order Cone Programming (SCOP)

NonConvex Quadratic Programming (QP)



# The following solvers and frameworks will be explored:

Solvers: CPLEX – Gurobi – GLPK – CBC – IPOPT – Couenne – SCIP

Frameworks: Pyomo – Or-Tools – PuLP – Pymoo

Same Packages and tools: Geneticalgorithm – Pyswarm – Numpy – Pandas – MatplotLib – Spyder – Jupyter Notebook



Moreover, you will learn how to apply some linearization techniques when using binary variables.



# In addition to the classes and exercises, the following problems will be solved step by step:

Optimization on how to install a fence in a garden

Route optimization problem

Maximize the revenue in a rental car store

Optimal Power Flow: Electrical Systems

Many other examples, some simple, some complexes, including summations and many constraints.
